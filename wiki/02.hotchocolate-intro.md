# Hotchocolate GraphQL

The project uses the library [Hotchocolate](https://chillicream.com/docs/hotchocolate) as GraphQL server implementation. It is not the only .Net implementation of a GraphQL server, but its ease and power are remarkable and the performances are much better than the Microsoft version.



## Banana Cake Pop

Let's begin to explore the scheme made.

To do this it is possible to begin to discover some of the tools of the GraphQL ecosystem, eg. [Banana Cake Pop](https://chillicream.com/docs/bananacakepop), which is incorporated in the HotChocolate library and made available at startup with the line:

```csharp
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    endpoints.MapGraphQL();
});
```

which allows you to access Banana Cake Pop via the `/graphql` route. BCP allows you to query our graphQL server.

## Query Language

"QL" in GraphQL obviously stands for Query Language and this is another relevant feature of this technology, in fact it allows you to manage in a declarative way even complex logics such as filters, variables or code reuse through `fragment`.

### Arguments
In the following query you can see how to extend our types by allowing our query methods to handle arguments

```graphql
query editori {
    publishers(skip:0, limit: 10) {
      id
      name
    }
}

query autori {
    authors(limit: 5) {
      id
      firstName
      surnName
    }
}

query autore {
    a1: authorById(id: "2d2cbbee-5a3a-4102-bc41-04679bfa2968") {
      firstName
      surnName
      webSite
      email
    }

    a2: authorById(id: "520163be-6122-47d3-91a4-56a203a5c2aa") {
      firstName
      surnName
      webSite
      email
    }    
}
```

#### Variables, directives e fragments

There are different types of [directives](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#directives) including:

- `@include(if: Boolean)`
- `@skip(if: Boolean)`

used in the following query:

```graphql
query autoriFragment($limit: Int, $shouldInclude: Boolean!) {
    authors(limit: $limit) @include(if:$shouldInclude) {
      ... Autore
    }
}

fragment Autore on Author {
  id
  firstName
  surnName
}
```

There are two types of fragments: `fragment` (as in the example above) which allow you to reuse the same block of information returned between different queries and `inline fragment` which allow you to manage fragments directly in queries:

```graphql
query autoriFragment($limit: Int, $shouldInclude: Boolean!) {
    authors(limit: $limit) @include(if:$shouldInclude) {
      ... on Author {
          id
          firstName
          surnName
      }
    }
}
```

This second mode is very useful when a query can return different kinds of types (very useful implementing Global Object Identification, as we will see later).
