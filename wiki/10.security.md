# Security

There's a lot to say about security, some useful links about that:

- [GraohQL.org Security](https://www.howtographql.com/advanced/4-security/)
- https://chillicream.com/docs/hotchocolate/v10/security/security
- https://chillicream.com/docs/hotchocolate/security/operation-complexity

In this intro I configured basic settings to face long execution time and maximum allowed query cost:

```csharp
public static IRequestExecutorBuilder SetSecurity(this IRequestExecutorBuilder builder)
{
    var options = new HotChocolate.Execution.Options.RequestExecutorOptions
    {
        ExecutionTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3),
        IncludeExceptionDetails = true,
    };
    options.Complexity.MaximumAllowed = 1000;
    options.Complexity.Enable = true;
    builder.SetRequestOptions(_ => options);
    return builder;
}
```

Now the GraphQL schema will change this way, e.g.:

```graphql
type Book implements Node {
  id: ID!
  authors: [Author!]!
  publisher: Publisher
  relatedBooks: [Book!]!
  authors: [Author!]! @cost(complexity: 5)
  publisher: Publisher @cost(complexity: 5)
  relatedBooks: [Book!]! @cost(complexity: 5)
  title: String
  abstract: String
  editionVersion: Int
  publicationDate: DateTime
  categories: [String!]
}
```

and if I try to run a very complex query:

```graphQL
query {
  books(first: 30, where: { title: { startsWith: "Reconstituirea" } }) {
    nodes {
      id
      title      
      authors {
        firstName
        surnName
      }
      relatedBooks {
        id
        title
        publicationDate
        relatedBooks {
          id
          title
          relatedBooks {
            id
            title
          }

        }
      }
    }
  }
}
``` 

The server result is:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "The maximum allowed operation complexity was exceeded.",
      "extensions": {
        "complexity": 1110,
        "allowedComplexity": 1000
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
